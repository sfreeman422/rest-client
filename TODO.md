# TODO

- Use https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tree-view/ to represent folders
- Consider using a {{}} to represent variables in requests. This will make organizing the collection more simple because we will have an understanding of what is a variable and what is not, to help keep collections clean. We will need to strip the {{}} before sending the request.
